## Description of Project: 

About 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability, of whom 2-4% experience significant difficulties in functioning. Among this statistic are individuals with weakened grip strength or hand amputees. Weakened grip strength or inability to perform grasping motions strongly limit the ability to perform daily household tasks. 

Our aim is to create a prototype of a mind controlled prosthetic hand that can conduct hand grasping motions based on the user’s thoughts. The objectives of our design are to: 
1) Create a prosthetic hand that can conduct the following two motions:
* Opening hand 
* Closing hand 

2) Identify the above two hand motions from EEG signals 

3) Retrieve relevant EEG signals from OpenBCI headset
